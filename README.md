Cleaning process:
-Copied raw data into a new working sheet
-Removed 26 duplicates
-Replaced single letter desciptors for marital status and sex for the entire word
-Created age brackets for each data point to fall into
	-Adult 25-39
	-Middle-aged 40-60

An international bicycle shop collected information from customers and potential customers (those who expressed interest in a bicycle, but ultimately did not purchase one). 

Recommended groups to targets for marketing:
	-Age range of 25-60 years old with families (married and have children)
	-Those in professional or clerical work with 0-1 mile commutes
	-Single adults (25-39 years old) with no children and a <1 mile commute

No further recommendations can be reliably made without additional information such as revenue, number of stores and their locations, as well as current and historical marketing strategies.
